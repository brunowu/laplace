# Laplace Parallel Implementation for learning

Different version of laplace method implementation of Heat Transfort Equation simulation. MPI, OpenMP, OpenACC codes come from the chanllenge in summer school [IHPCSS2017](http://www.ihpcss.org)

Two different hybrid MPI + OpenACC implementations are added, one is my codes in the challendge, the other is the winner codes in this challendge, from Jiachao Zhang (张 家超 [zjc-sunny@hotmail.com]) from Japan. 

XMP version added by myself using the distributed memory directives language developped by [RIKEN Japan](http://www.xcalablemp.org)



furture plan:

XcalableMP + OpenACC = XACC version of different kinds of accelertors (GPU and MICs): XACC is acclerator version of XMP, which combines the XMP and OpenACC with some extended functions.

XcalableMP + OpenMP version
